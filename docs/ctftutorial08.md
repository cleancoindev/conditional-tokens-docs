Previously, we split collateral into positions `(A)` and `(B|C)`. But we there are many more valid splits we can make with the conditions we have created.

Here is an example of some valid and invalid splits, either from collateral ($) or from other positions.

Looking at the below image of positions, you'll notice a second layer of positions, this tied very closely to the parent collection ID parameter. When we passed in `0x0` as the parent `collectionId` what we are telling the contract is we would like to start from the root collection or the collateral token directly.

A simple example, using our previous positions, would be to split `(B|C)` into `(B)` and `(C)`. You can try this split with the current state of the conditional tokens contract on your development chain.

To do this, we will call `splitPosition()`, keeping the `collateralToken` the same using using the address of one of your ToyTokens.

We will also keep the `parentCollectionId` the same, `0x0`. The parent collection ID can be roughly thought of as the next level up.

We'll keep the `conditionId` the same as well, because that is the condition that outcome collections containing only `(B)` and only `(C)`.

Change that occurs here is in the partition. We want to figure out the index set values for only B and only C. With the process noted earlier, we can find those values. For example, the index set for the outcome collection containing only `(B)` is `2`, and the index set for the outcome collection containing only `(C)` is `(4)`.

Since this does not cover all of the outcome slots in the condition, the split will actually look for value in the position `(B|C)` instead of trying to get value from one level up, or in this case is from the collateral token.

Try calling `splitPosition()` to split a portion of your `(B|C)` position into `(B)` and `(C)`.

Using the same method as earlier, you should be able to derive the `positionId` for these new positions and check your balance of positions `(B|C)`, `(B)`, and `(C)`.

In the next sections, we'll cover combining outcome collections and splitting into deeper positions.
